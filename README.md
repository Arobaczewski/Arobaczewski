## 🚀 From Closing Deals to Closing Divs

After 8+ years in tech sales and management at AT&T and Verizon, I discovered my passion for coding in **March 2025**. Nine months later, I'm building production-ready applications that solve real business problems and deliver measurable value.

**What makes me different?** I bring the rare combination of:
- 💼 **Business acumen** from years of enterprise sales and customer success
- 🎯 **User-centered thinking** from understanding what customers actually need
- ⚡ **Rapid learning ability** with a proven track record of mastering new technologies quickly
- 🛠️ **Production experience** building apps that are actively used in real businesses

I'm not just learning to code, I'm building solutions that matter.
