# Hey, I'm Alexander Robaczewski 👋

**Career-changer turning 8+ years of tech sales experience into full-stack development expertise**

After years of selling technology at AT&T and Verizon, I realized I loved the tech but hated the sales pressure. So I made the leap - quit my corporate job and dove headfirst into coding. **Best decision I ever made.**

## 🚀 My Journey

From **tech sales manager** → **cannabis retail** → **full-stack developer**

In March 2025, I enrolled in Codecademy's full-stack development course and immediately knew I'd found my calling. The problem-solving aspect of coding gives me that rush I was always chasing - there's nothing quite like finally solving a bug that's been driving you crazy for hours! 🧩
